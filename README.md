## BeastMaster NPC

-   Latest build status with azerothcore: [![core-build](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-npc-beastmaster/actions/workflows/core-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/azerothcore/mod-npc-beastmaster/actions/workflows/core-build.yml)

# AzerothCore - BeastMaster NPC

## Description

This module allows **all classes** (not just hunters) to adopt and use hunter pets by interacting with a special NPC. The NPC provides:

-   Hunter skills (for non-hunters)
-   Adoption of normal, rare, and exotic pets (all loaded from `beastmaster_tames` table)
-   Pet food vendor
-   Stables (for hunters)
-   **Tracked pets system**: view, summon, rename, and delete your adopted pets

Players can also summon the Beastmaster NPC anywhere using chat commands.

## Important Notes

-   You have to use at least AzerothCore commit [3f0739f](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/commit/3f0739f1c9a5289444ff9d62834b7ceb38879ba9).
-   The config file (`mod_npc_beastmaster.conf.dist`) controls rare and rare exotic pet highlighting by entry ID.
-   Tracked pets are stored in the `beastmaster_tamed_pets` table in your characters database.
-   Profanity filtering for pet names uses `conf/profanity.txt` (reloads automatically if changed).
-   Tracked pets cache is session-based, thread-safe, and updates instantly after rename/delete.

## Tracked Pets Feature

-   When you adopt a pet, it is automatically tracked and stored in the database.
-   You can view your tracked pets from the BeastMaster NPC menu (all classes supported).
-   For each tracked pet, you can:
    -   **Summon**: Instantly summon the pet if you do not already have one out.
    -   **Rename**: Select "Rename" and then type the new name in chat using the `.petname rename <name>` command. Type `.petname cancel` to abort.
    -   **Delete**: Remove the pet from your tracked list (with confirmation).
-   The tracked pets menu supports pagination if you have many pets.
-   The menu displays each pet's name, date tamed, family, and rarity.
-   Tracked pets update instantly after rename or delete.

## Pet Rename Commands

When you choose to rename a pet, you must use the following chat commands:

-   `.petname rename <newname>` — Renames your selected pet to `<newname>`.
-   `.petname cancel` — Cancels the renaming process.

If you type anything else, you will be reminded of these commands.

## How to use ingame

### Option 1: Chat Commands (Recommended)

Players can summon the Beastmaster anywhere using a chat command:

-   `.beastmaster` — Summons the Beastmaster NPC at your location for 2 minutes

### Option 2: Spawn NPC Permanently

As GM you can spawn the NPC:

-   Temporary (lost on restart):

```bash
.npc add 601026
```

-   Make it permanent after placing:

```bash
.npc add 601026
.npc save
```

If you need to delete it later:

```bash
.npc delete
```

The NPC will appear as "White Fang" (entry: **601026**).

> **Note:**
> The value `601026` is the default Beastmaster NPC entry used by this module.
> If you wish to use a different NPC entry, update the `BeastMaster.NpcEntry` value in your `mod_npc_beastmaster.conf` file and adjust your database and configuration accordingly.

## Player Login Notice

When players log in, they will see a helpful message:

> **BeastMaster Commands Available!**
> Type `.beastmaster` to summon the Beastmaster and adopt pets!

This notice can be disabled in the configuration file if desired.

## Notice

Due to the uniqueness of the module you will get this message on the worldconsole, but nothing is broken.
It is due to the npc not exactly having a gossip menu in the database, the script handles the gossip menu.

To suppress this warning, add the following to your worldserver config:

```
#    Creatures.CustomIDs
#        Description: The list of custom creatures with gossip dialogues hardcoded in core,
#                     divided by "," without spaces.
#                     It is implied that you do not use for these NPC dialogs data from "gossip_menu" table.
#                     Server will skip these IDs during the definitions validation process.
#        Example:     Creatures.CustomIDs = "190010,55005,999991,25462,98888,601026" - Npcs for Transmog, Guild-zone, 1v1-arena modules
#                                                                               Skip Dk Module, Racial Trait Swap Modules
#        Default:     ""

Creatures.CustomIDs = "190010,55005,999991,25462,98888,601026"
```

## Configuration

See `conf/mod_npc_beastmaster.conf.dist` for all options. Key options summary:

| Option                                    | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BeastMaster.Enable                        | Master enable switch for the module.                                       |
| BeastMaster.HunterOnly                    | Restrict usage to hunters only (overrides AllowedClasses for non-hunters). |
| BeastMaster.AllowedClasses / AllowedRaces | Allow-list filters when HunterOnly=0 (0 = all).                            |
| BeastMaster.MinLevel / MaxLevel           | Level gating (0 disables the respective bound).                            |
| BeastMaster.AllowExotic                   | Allow exotic pets to non-hunters (ignores HunterBeastMasteryRequired).     |
| BeastMaster.HunterBeastMasteryRequired    | Hunters must have Beast Mastery talent for exotic pets.                    |
| BeastMaster.TrackTamedPets                | Enable tracked pets menu & DB storage.                                     |
| BeastMaster.MaxTrackedPets                | Cap on tracked pets (0 = unlimited; >1000 not recommended).                |
| BeastMaster.KeepPetHappy                  | Keeps pet happiness maxed (QoL).                                           |
| BeastMaster.ProfanityFilter               | Dynamic profanity name filter (auto reloads on file change).               |
| BeastMaster.SummonCooldown                | Cooldown in seconds for .beastmaster command.                              |
| BeastMaster.NpcEntry                      | NPC entry used for summoning and DB records.                               |
| BeastMaster.RarePets / RareExoticPets     | Entry ID lists that show as rare/rare exotic in menus.                     |

Behavior notes:

-   If HunterOnly=1 it supersedes non-hunter class allowances.
-   AllowExotic=1 lets non-hunters adopt exotic pets even if HunterBeastMasteryRequired=1.
-   MaxTrackedPets=0 means unlimited; very large collections may have performance impact when listing.

## Edit module configuration (optional)

If you need to change the module configuration, go to your server configuration folder (where your `worldserver` or `worldserver.exe` is), copy `mod_npc_beastmaster.conf.dist` to `mod_npc_beastmaster.conf` and edit that new file.

(If using Docker, place the `mod_npc_beastmaster.conf` file into your `azerothcore-wotlk/docker/worldserver/etc` folder.)

## Customization

-   **NPC Entry:**
    The default Beastmaster NPC entry is `601026`.
    To use a different entry, set the `BeastMaster.NpcEntry` option in your `mod_npc_beastmaster.conf` file and update your database if needed.

-   **Login Notifications:**
    Login notifications can be enabled/disabled via the `BeastMaster.ShowLoginNotice` configuration option.
